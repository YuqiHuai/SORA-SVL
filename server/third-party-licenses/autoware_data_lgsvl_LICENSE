You may not use Licensed Materials and Derivatives as software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-service or other similar online service for commercial purposes.  Commercial purposes include, but are not limited to activities of sale, rent, or transfer for charge or other consideration received, directly or indirectly, to a third party in connection with a business or endeavor intended for profit.


2	UPDATES.
You acknowledge that LG may update or modify the Licensed Material from time to time and that such updates and modifications may adversely affect the manner in which You access or communicate with the Licensed Material.

3.2	Termination.  This Agreement will be terminated immediately by LG at any time, by providing written notice to You (such notice may be via email) upon breach of any term or condition of this Agreement.  Upon termination, You and any sublicensees will cease access to the Licensed Material, and destroy all copies of the Licensed Material (including all derivatives thereof) You have obtained or created.  Sections 4-8 will survive the termination of this Agreement.  


4	OWNERSHIP; FEEDBACK. 

4.1	Ownership.  As between You and LG, LG owns all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Material (and any LG modifications or enhancements thereof), including but not limited to all intellectual property rights therein. Any rights not expressly granted herein are withheld.  As between You and LG, You (or the third party content provider) own all right, title and interest in and to the Simulator Content.

You agree to provide LG with comments concerning the Licensed Material and Your evaluation and use thereof, including bug reports, evaluations, proposed product integrations (and associated metrics and learned knowledge) (“Feedback”).  You agree that LG and its designees will be free to copy, modify, create derivative works, publicly display, disclose, distribute, license and sublicense, incorporate and otherwise use the Feedback, including derivative works thereto, for any and all commercial and non-commercial purposes with no obligation of any kind to You. 

4.3	Open Source.  You hereby acknowledge that the Licensed Materials may contain Open Source Software.  “Open Source Software” means any software or software component, module or package that contains, or is derived in any manner (in whole or in part) from, any software that is distributed as free software, open source software or similar licensing or distribution models.  To the extent any such license requires that LG provide You the rights to copy, modify, distribute or otherwise use any Open Source Software that are inconsistent with the limited rights granted to You in this Agreement, then such rights in the applicable Open Source Software license shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such Open Source Software.  You agree to review any documentation that accompanies the Licensed Materials or is identified in a link provided in the documentation for the Licensed Materials in order to determine which portions of the Licensed Materials are Open Source Software and are licensed under an Open Source Software license.  You acknowledge that the Open Source Software license is solely between You and the applicable licensor of the Open Source Software.  You shall comply with the terms of all applicable Open Source Software licenses, if any.


5	REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMER.

You represent and warrant that: (a) the performance of Your obligations will not constitute a breach or otherwise violate any other agreement or the rights of any third party arising therefrom; and (b) You will maintain throughout the Term all rights and licenses that are required with respect to use of the Licensed Material, and Your use does and will continue to comply with all applicable foreign, federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. IN ANY CASE, LG’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEE, IF ANY, THAT YOU PAID LG FOR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL.


7	INDEMNIFICATION.  

You will indemnify, defend, or at its option settle and hold LG, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and employees, harmless from any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, actions, judgments, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) brought by a third party arising out of or in connection with: (a) any intentionally tortious or negligent act or omission by You in connection with Your use of the Licensed Material; (b) Your use of the Licensed Material other than as expressly allowed by this Agreement; (c) any claims that Derivatives or Simulator Content have infringed third party intellectual property rights; or (d) Your breach or alleged breach of any of the terms, restrictions, obligations or representations under this Agreement.
